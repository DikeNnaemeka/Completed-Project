### Data Source
---

The primary data used for this analysis is "bike_data.xlsx" file. It comprises of detailed information used for the analysis.

### Tools
---

- Excel (Data Cleaning/Preparation)
- Excel (Data Analysis)
- Excel (Creating report/Visualization)

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
---

In the initial data preparation phase, we completed the following task;
 1. Data loading and inspection
 2. Handling missing data
 3. Data cleaning
 4. Creating new columuns for Age range (using the IF Function)
 5. Use the Replace and Find Function

### Exploratory Data Analysis
---

This involve exploring the bike data to answer key question, such as;

- Which age range uses the bike the most?
- Which occupation uses bike the most?
- Which Gender uses bike the most?
- which marital status uses bike the most?
- Whioch gender uses bike the most?
  
  ### Data Analysis
  ---
We analysed the data using Pivot table in Excel.
  
   ### Results and Findings
   ---
   
- The middle age uses and purchases bike the most, followed by the old age. The adolecent age uses little or no bike at all.
- Commuters within the distance range of 0-1 miles uses the most bikes. Commuters with more than 10 miles are the least bike users.
- The male gender are the most bike users, though a good number of females uses bike too.
- The professional skilled are the most users of bike. The management and the skilled manual also have a good number of bike users. The manual are the least biked users.
- It was discovered that the married also uses and purchased more bike than the single.
- It wa discovered that females with Bachelors education purchased more bike than their male counterparts and most of them commute distance of 0-10 miles. In terms of Graduate degree, male purchased more bike than their female counterparts. High school educationvhas more bike users, it was also discovered that those that those commute between 5-10 miles purchases the least amount of bikes. Partial college also have more male bike users and a large number of commute between 0-1 miles don't use or purchase bike.
- North America is the region with the most bike users and Europe is the rfegion with the least bike users.

  ### Recommendation
  ---
  Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions;

- Invest in more bikes made for the middle class
- Invest in marketing and promotion activities for the adolecent age, educate them on the importance of owning a bike.
- Implement a high customer segementation, that will target more consumers in North America

### Limitation
---

I had to group the ages into ranges using the IF statement in Excel because, they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusion frpm my analysis.
